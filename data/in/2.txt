(CNN)A Philadelphia firefighter died early Saturday in a building that collapsed soon after a fire there was extinguished, while four comrades and a city worker were pulled alive from the rubble, a fire official said.

The collapse of 300 W. Indiana Ave. in the city's Fairhill neighborhood came shortly before 3:30 a.m. -- about 90 minutes after firefighters were called to fight the fire there -- and sent colleagues scrambling to rescue those trapped inside, 1st Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said.
"Our department lost a member bravely fighting a fire and then caught in a building collapse after the fire was over," he said.
"We just finished up pulling ... our brothers out of this place. It's going to be a rough few weeks coming up," Murphy told reporters Saturday morning.
Details about what led to the fire in the building and what it housed weren't immediately available; city records describe it as a three-story structure in a commercial/mixed-use part of town.
Of the six trapped in total, five -- four firefighters and a city licensing and inspections worker -- were rescued and sent to a hospital. The licensing worker was released; the four firefighters remained hospitalized Saturday morning in stable condition, Murphy said.
